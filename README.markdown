#Handcrafted Webby

##Introduction

Handcrafted Webby is a starting point for a Webby project that's been tweaked and turned to use [HAML](http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/), [SASS](http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/docs/rdoc/classes/Sass.html) and [Compass](http://github.com/chriseppstein/compass) out of the box, along with jQuery and some other niceties we do to make Webby our own.

Please, feel free to contribute. If you have questions, call 1-800-513-7421 or email us at [hello@gethandcrafted.com](mailto:hello@gethandcrafted.com).
